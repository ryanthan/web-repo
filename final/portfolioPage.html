              <h3>Ludos</h3>
              <p>Ludos is an iOS app created using Xcode that presents users with an extensive list of video games gathered from the RAWG API. Users are able to search
                   for specific games, use filters to focus on their desired platforms/genres, add games to a favorites list, and find new games through the random feature.</p>
              <br>
              <p>You can find an early interactable prototype of this app <a href="https://www.figma.com/proto/IVsbRBWXxU5qIoGwhI8dgJ/Video-Game-Recommender?node-id=0%3A3&scaling=scale-down&page-id=0%3A1" target="_blank">here</a> and

              <h3>INSIGHTS Intervention</h3>
              <p>For my senior capstone project at the University of Colorado Boulder, my team and I were paired with <a href="https://insightsintervention.com/" target="_blank">INSIGHTS Intervention</a>, an evidence-based 
                  intervention with parenting, teacher, and primary grade classroom programs. We were in charge of enhancing the overall user experience of their 
                  official website and building a mobile application using React Native. I was in charge of the overall creative design and worked on both the website 
                  and front-end of the application.</p>
              <br>
              <p>You can find the application <a href="http://mobile.insightsintervention.com/" target="_blank">here</a> and the initial prototype <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/kfFAUJCEowte0MgGSY0E9G/Insights-Companion-App?node-id=0%3A1" target="_blank">here</a>. You can also view my team’s presentation 
                  of our completed application <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eGHResRP-OW7zRGPPmQ6MXwXVGYAVl3p/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

              <h3>Tactile Picture Books</h3>
              <p>I have designed and constructed two separate tactile picture books based off The Very Hungry Caterpillar by Eric Carle and If I Crossed the Road by 
                  Stephen Kroninger. These books serve to provide visually impaired learners an opportunity to experience popular children’s stories. By 3D modeling, 
                  3D printing, experimenting with different textures, and utilizing braille, we are able to let users experience these stories in a unique way.</p>

              <h3>Onett</h3>
              <p>For my final project in a Computer Graphics course, I recreated a section of the fictional city Onett from the 1994 role playing game EarthBound. This 
                  town was created entirely from scratch in C using the Open Graphics Library (OpenGL). The town can be viewed from orthogonal, perspective, and first-person modes.
                  The program can be found <a href="https://github.com/ryanthan/Graphics_FinalProject_Onett">here</a>.</p>
